>>>>>vienen:1	["<p>I do however have to take issue with your comment about spoon-feeding. While I completely agree that Dave is an absolutely fantastic teacher, and the course layout was excellent, I still maintain that CS-101 was inherently designed to be self-contained and expose you to all the syntax and concepts necessary to solve the problems. Of the 2 classes I've seen so far, both CS-212 and to a lesser extent, CS-253 are not designed to teach you every bit of Python syntax that could make your life easier. While I'm sure they could be designed to do so, they would probably be a LOT longer than 6 week chunks, and ultimately, the instructors are primarily trying to teach us important CS concepts, not go over the ins and outs of Python syntax. It is going to be harder and harder to have completely self contained classes like CS-101 as we move to more advanced classes. You can still tackle all the problems and solve them, but then you will learn about newer, faster, easier ways of solving the problems that you were perhaps previously unaware of. I get that it can be frustrating, because I was one of the frustrated folks in CS-212, but after another couple of units, my perspective has completely changed and I look forward to learning new tricks and concepts when I load one of the instructor's solutions.</p>"]
